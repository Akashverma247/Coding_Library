/*
 re you fond of collecting some kind of stuff? Mike is crazy about collecting stamps. He is an active member of Stamp Collecting Ð¡ommunity(SCC).

 SCC consists of N members which are fond of philately. A few days ago Mike argued with the others from SCC. Mike told them that all stamps of the members could be divided in such a way that i'th member would get i postage stamps. Now Mike wants to know if he was right. The next SCC meeting is tomorrow. Mike still has no answer.

 So, help Mike! There are N members in the SCC, i'th member has Ci stamps in his collection. Your task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute C1 + C2 + ... + Cn stamps among the members of SCC thus that i'th member would get i stamps.
