/*

 Polycarp has guessed three positive integers a,b and c. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order â€” their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: a+b,a+c,b+c and a+b+c.
 You have to guess three numbers a,b adn c using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.
